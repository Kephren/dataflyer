## DataFlyer

This was a project I started while working heavily with Excel and Access.

I was using Access for a lot of the work I did at the time and decided to expand its capability. This project was my first in depth encounter with regular expressions and allowed me to do substring parsing without having to program something for every special use case.

This is an application that runs inside a Access database with a DSL for text parsing. It is not complete, but is a good starting point. I wanted to eventually to move this project to a full programming language with two different projects Axiom(Scala based - stream parser) and Pivot(JavaScript - generic map/route editor).

DataFlyer is a good concept and I was happy with how far I got in such a limited environment. Visual Basic is not made to handle large collections or data structures. The fact that it was in Access is even worse.
